# NationalPark Service

For this project, we will interpret data from the National Parks Service about endangered species in different parks.
We will perform some data analysis on the conservation statuses of these species and investigate if there are any patterns or themes to the types of species that become endangered. During this project, you will analyze, clean up, and plot data as well as pose questions and seek to answer them in a meaningful way.
